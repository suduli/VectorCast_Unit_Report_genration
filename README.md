```

## 💡 Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Navigate to your VectorCAST project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/vectorcast/project
   ```

2. **Execute the generator**:
   ```bash
   python Unit_Test_Report_generator.py
   ```

3. **Follow the interactive prompts**:
   ```
   📝 Enter the Module Name: MyModule
   🔄 Do you want separate test scripts for Compound Test Cases? (Y/N): Y
   ```

### Advanced Usage

#### Custom VectorCAST Path
```python
# If VectorCAST is installed in a non-standard location
from Unit_Test_Report_generator import UnitTestReportGenerator

generator = UnitTestReportGenerator(vcast_path="/custom/path/to/clicast.exe")
generator.run()
```

#### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process multiple modules
for module in ModuleA ModuleB ModuleC; do
    echo "Processing $module"
    cd "$module"
    python ../Unit_Test_Report_generator.py
    cd ..
done
```

### Generated Directory Structure

After successful execution, your project will have:

```
YourProject/
├── Unit_Tst/                     # Individual function test scripts
│   ├── function1.tst
│   ├── function2.tst
│   ├── function3.tst
│   └── __COMPOUND__.tst          # (if compound tests enabled)
├── Results/                      # Comprehensive reports
│   ├── YOURMODULE.tst           # Master test script
│   ├── YourModule_Full_Report.html
│   ├── YourModule_Testcase_Management_Report.html
│   └── YourModule_Execution_Results_Report.html
└── [your original files]
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: "VectorCAST CLI not found"
**Symptoms**: Error message about missing `clicast.exe`
**Solutions**:
1. Verify VectorCAST installation: Check if `C:\VCAST\clicast.exe` exists
2. Update the path in the script if VectorCAST is installed elsewhere
3. Add VectorCAST to your system PATH

#### Issue: "Environment file not found"
**Symptoms**: Script fails to locate `.env` file
**Solutions**:
1. Ensure you're running the script from the correct directory
2. Verify the environment file exists and has the correct naming convention
3. Check file permissions and accessibility

#### Issue: "Command execution failed"
**Symptoms**: VectorCAST commands return error codes
**Solutions**:
1. Verify VectorCAST environment is properly configured
2. Check that the environment file is valid and not corrupted
3. Ensure sufficient disk space and permissions
4. Review VectorCAST logs for detailed error information

#### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Symptoms**: Cannot create directories or move files
**Solutions**:
1. Run with administrator privileges (Windows) or sudo (Linux/macOS)
2. Check directory write permissions
3. Ensure antivirus software isn't blocking file operations

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose output for troubleshooting:
```python
# Add at the beginning of the script
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```
